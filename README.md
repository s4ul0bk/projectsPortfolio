I have been working on IT projects in a relevant tourism and entertainment group for almost 11 years helping the company achieve its strategic objectives.

I have knowledge of all stages of developing a business solution using the concepts and tools of Data Science, from understanding the business to publishing the model in production using Clouds.

I have already developed solutions for important business problemas such as detecting fraud transactions, sales forecast and prioritizing customers for cross-selling.

The details of each solution are described in the projects below.

**Analytical Tools:**
**Data Collect and Storage:** SQL, MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server, Oracle, Pentaho Data Integration, Talend data Integration.
**Data Processing and Analysis:** Python
**Development:** Git, Scrum, Linux.
**Data Vizualization:** Power BI.
**Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression.
**Machine Learning Deployment:** Heroku Cloud Application Platform, Flask API

## Data Science Projects:

### [Sales Forecast]( https://github.com/s4ul0bk/RossmannSalesForescast )

Machine Learning and predict next 6 week sales. Company need to identify the sales forecast to next 6 weeks to invest on shops reform.
In this project, i built a Machine Learning regressort to predict sales forecast with ** X% of accuracy**.
The model is available in [telegram bot](http://t.me/rossman_scunha_bot). Send a shop number (99) and his will [responde](https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6744631371647500288) you a sale forecast.

### [Fraud Detection]( https://github.com/s4ul0bk/blockerFraud )

Machine Learning and taking fraud detection. Companies are reducing their costs with detecting fraudulent transactions, while companies providing theses types of services are increasing thier income.
In this project, I built a Machine Learning classifier to label fraudulent transactions with **99.51% of accuracy.**
The performance of this model would bring **revenue of U$623,2 millions** according to the company's business model described in the problem definition.

### Customer priorizing for vehicle insurance cross-sell - In Progress
Machine Learning and taking fraud detection. Companies are reducing their costs with detecting fraudulent transactions, while companies providing theses types of services are increasing thier income.
This project is in progress.
